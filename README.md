ChampOS
A Linux distrabution for cyber.local. It is a service based project with the customers being Devin, Duane, and Adam G. I will be working with Young for this project. 
ChampOS would have commonly used security tools and other tools that would be needed for classes. We will be having a meeting this week to get specifics of the project and what is expected. 
It will be useful for me to learn how to build a linux distro as well as help the CNCS program.
